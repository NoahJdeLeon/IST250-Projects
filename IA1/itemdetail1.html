<pre id="preface">
    So ya wanna know more about these cards eh? Well I beleive I already gave a
pretty good description of the cards on the previous page, but I guess I can do
a bit more over here.

    First off, all these cards are HEAVILY used. I'm talking bought by children
the exact year they came out, admired, and then promptly carried around in
backpacks and run through the wash because some were left in pockets. The
Yu-Gi-Oh! cards are much more worn down due to the fact that the actual game was
played by the previous owners, while the Pok√©mon cards are in better condition
since they were collected and placed in card collection books. However, by no
means are any of these cards worth any real value beyond them being some of the
first editions of the card game, as none as far as I know are particularly rare.
Regardless, If you're into the whole nostalgia thing these sets will be perfect
for you.
