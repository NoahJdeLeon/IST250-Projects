                            <p>Basically any digital recording setup will need some sort of computer. The details 
                                of which are entirely up to you. Just know, that the larger the size of the project 
                                you are trying to work on, the more necessary the storage and processing power of 
                                said device will be. Note, any smartphone or tablet can fulfil this option too, and 
                                often times negates the need for any further hardware depending on how "professional" 
                                you want your recording to be.

                            <p>The basic setup for recording anything is a device to record on, and a microphone to 
                                capture that recording. Now the type of microphone depends again on that "professionality" 
                                scale, but honestly most microphones have the capability nowadays to be really good, 
                                since mainly the best way to make a mic sound good is by being in a good recording 
                                environment. Again if you are working on a laptop, smartphone or tablet, these items 
                                will likely already have them built in, so you may not need this but it may still be 
                                for your benefit if you get an external USB mic to start. I reccomend making sure that 
                                this is a CABLED connection, as bluetooth tends to deminish the quality by a lot.

                            <p>Not entirely necessary but you probably already have a set of these lying around. For
                                any recording process it's useful to have a critical ear for your work, meaning outside
                                noise while making the recording can be a distraction. I also reccomend using cabled 
                                connections since bluetooth adds delay between hitting the spacebar and the actual 
                                playback. There are mostly 3 types of headphones to look out for depending on your 
                                environment: earbuds, closed back, and open back headphones. Earbuds are great for 
                                being cheap, compact and easy. They get the job done. Closed back headphones are great 
                                for isolating your ears from the rest of the world, but may lose some of the "wideness"
                                of stereo effects due to the nature of the design. Open backs are just the opposite.
                                They let all noise in and out of the headphones, but the wuality of sound tends to be
                                better. If you are in a particularly noisy environment I reccomend going for the closed
                                backs.

                            <p>So you're looking to improve on your gear, or looking to find some way of driectly 
                                recording instruments? An audio interface is the choice for that purpose. Now, some 
                                interfaces can be a bit confusing on how they work, but essentially they act as a 
                                middleman between an instrument/microphone and your computer. Commonly you'll find 
                                that audio interfaces connect via USB to the computer, and have a combination input 
                                that takes 2 separate types of cables (although cheaper models may just have a 1/4" 
                                input jack). This is where you'll probably have to start worrying about cable types, 
                                since they are also necessary for this to work. The combo jacks take in 1/4" or 
                                sometimes called guitar cables, which usually come in mono inputs. You can find 
                                stereo cables but most jacks only take input in mono so these won't work. The other 
                                cable type the combo jacks take are XLR cables, which do similar stuff but have some 
                                other benefits to them. Lastly, some audio interfaces have the ability to supply what 
                                is called phantom power, which is a term you should get familiar with before plugging 
                                in any random microphone to the interface (it can damage some if used improperly).

                            <p>This is not necessary if you already got one before, but typically if you are looking to 
                                upgrade to using an audio interface, you likely will be also looking for ways to use it. 
                                The microphones that connect via USB can be great, but many qualities of mics connected 
                                via interface tend to be of much higher quality in a recording in the long run. There are 
                                three main types of microphones that you now need to consider: dynamic, condenser, and 
                                ribbon. These all have their own unique qualities that differentiate themselves from each 
                                other, so finding the style you want is crucial. Dynamic mics typically don't require 
                                phantom power, while most condenser mics do, and ribbon mics have some that do and some 
                                that don't. Keeping this in mind for what interface you have is essential. Also, make sure 
                                you turn phanotm power on (if you have it) AFTER, you plug the mic in to avoid potential 
                                damage to the mic.

                            <p>While mainly these are used for making and arranging music, the uses these have for any recording
                                process is limitless. You might want to experiment with the free trials of many of these, 
                                as the way they work differs greatly between program. These can get expensive but if you are 
                                set on expanding the hobby they make life a lot easier. Now if you are specifically a podcast 
                                recorder or focus mainly on only voice recordings, you can stop before you get to this point 
                                as you likely aren't interested in recording music. If this is the case, Audacity is an excellent 
                                free program. Many other programs also have the option for just voice recording (even if they 
                                aren't specifically designed for it) so these are all options too.

                            <p>These are the standard appliance for anyone wanting to get into audio. They essentially 
                                are a set of stereo speakers designed to give the best critical listening experience to
                                anyone in front of them. For these you need to consider the size, and frequency range 
                                when buying. When setting them up, it is best to make suer that the middle of the speakers 
                                form an equillateral triangle with your head so that you are getting the best possible 
                                sound out of them (they tend to be very directional). While cabling isn't the biggest deal 
                                some studio monitors have the option of a balanced input. Use that if you can, it decreases 
                                electrical noise.

                                advice to not make the input volume too loud, it will clip if you do.

                                advice as to the hardware aspect of things here, its that you may just want to consult 
                                an actual professional about treating your room rather than having to spend hours on end 
                                trying to get the placement of foam panels just right. You might also keep the room in 
                                mind when approaching this tactic, since the size and shape of the room always affects 
                                the sound in the end.
