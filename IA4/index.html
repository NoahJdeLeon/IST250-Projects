        <h1>A Beginners Guide to Digital Recording Hardware</h1>
        <div id="section">
            <p>Hello! You probably are on this page because you want to know a little bit about the
                types of hardware you may need for any sort of recording process on a digital device,
                this page serves as a guide for beginners on what is necessary for that to happen and
                for who certain pieces of hardware are most applicable. This will be in order of total
                spending costs so that if you find that things don't start to apply to you anymore you
                can just stop.
